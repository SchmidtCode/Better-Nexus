# PLAN

## Stage 50 — Sync Trust package partition

- Goal: publish Package A as a small reviewable trust boundary, then stop before
  the separately designed Package B catalog-authority state machine.
- Decision: Package A owns issues #24, #27, and #31 only.
- Decision: Package B owns issue #22 and every catalog admission, tombstone,
  retention, compaction, semantic-envelope, and rollback authority change.

### 50.1 — Publish Package A (#24, #27, #31)

- Status: `IN_REVIEW`
- Objective:
  - Publish one clean draft PR directly atop exact PR #67.
- Deliverables:
  - Reversible inert presentation for untrusted remote text.
  - No unsolicited remote developer-status reply.
  - Peer versions retained as bounded observations without release authority.
  - Focused regressions, exact-head local gates, and exact-head GitHub CI.
- Acceptance:
  - [x] Raw storage and evidence remain lossless and separate from display text.
  - [x] Rich-text and focused EditBox sinks receive inert projections.
  - [x] Remote WLRQ handling is inert without rejection spam or pending state.
  - [x] Peer observations cannot create or preserve authoritative update notices.
  - [x] Package B and typed-digest owners remain outside the diff.
  - [x] Independent Spec and Standards reviews pass.
  - [ ] Final exact-head Fast and Full pass.
  - [ ] Draft PR and required exact-head CI pass.
- Evidence:
  - `.vibe/EVIDENCE.md` Stage 50.1 reconstruction and review receipt.

### 50.2 — Define Package B catalog authority (#22)

depends_on: [50.1]

- Status: `NOT_STARTED`
- Objective:
  - Define one architecture-approved catalog-authority state machine before any
    Package B implementation.
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Master review supplies the authority model and bounded implementation
    contract after Package A publication.
  - [ ] No Package B product, test, branch, or worktree work starts early.
